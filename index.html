	   <p><b>I highly recommend Famous Driving School.</b><br>
	    Over the last couple of weeks I had instructors that worked with me to improve my driving skill 
	    and build my confidence on the road, ultimately enabling me to pass my driving test. They were an 
	    instrumental part of my driving journey, helping me to identify and address poor driving habits I 
	    had unknowingly picked up from a previous instructor. The instructions were calm, patient and 
	    coherent, and I enjoyed our drives together! Could not have asked for a better establishment to get me over the finish line. Many thanks to Famous Driving School, once again.</p>

	   <p><b>A decent driving school.</b><br>
	    The team go out of their way to support the learners. The ladies at reception all work so well 
	    together and really try to accommodate a dynamic situation. My instructor was very busy but managed to fit me in and again went out of his way to support me. I have yet to find any business as focused on customer support, thank you guys highly recommend for all your driving needs.</p>
