	   <h3>How many lessons will I need to learn to drive?</h3>
	   <p>
	    This depends very much on your general skills, age and the time you can invest in your driving lessons. 
		According to official statistics, the average person takes about 45 lessons with an instructor plus 22 
		private hours to pass the test. Generally, learners who have been cycling, riding a moped or have similar 
		experience will learn to drive more easily. However, our friendly and professional instructors are 
		trained to teach also those who are less skilled!
	   </p>
	   
	   <h3>I am very anxious, will I need more driving lessons than other learners?</h3>
	   <p>
	    From experience, there is generally no significant difference between the amount of lessons needed for 
		anxious learners and those who are relatively confident. It is natural for new learners to think that they 
		are more anxious than others, but they will overcome this problem throughout the course. Remember, learning 
		to drive with YES! Driving School is supposed to be fun as well!
	   </p>
	   
	   <h3>I have recently moved to the UK, can I transfer the driving licence from my home country?</h3>
	   <p>
	    Foreign licence holders from countries specified on the DVLA website are generally allowed to drive in the 
		UK for 12 months but have to pass a test before this time elapses in order to continue to drive as a ‚Äúfull 
		licence holder‚Äù. To apply for the test foreign licence holders need a provisional licence just as UK 
		applicants, but don‚Äôt have to display ‚ÄúL‚Äù-plates and don‚Äôt have to drive under supervision within the 12 
		months period. However, we highly recommend to take driving lessons with a professional YES! instructor ‚Äì 
		even if you are an experienced driver, the UK driving test is very demanding and often underestimated.
